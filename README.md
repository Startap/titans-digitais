# Landing page framework
This is a simple PHP framework to display and render landing pages, built especially to digital products.

# What tech we use?
We use Composer as our main library dependency management in this project. In the rest of application we developed this framework using PHP and CSS/HTML/JS. 

# Roadmap
In our Issues we have many improvements planned to include in this framework. The main features that we plan to include are:

- [ ] Answer to POST requests to provide support to contact form
- [ ] Automagically resolved 404 pages when no route was found
- [ ] SASS compiler to build assets
